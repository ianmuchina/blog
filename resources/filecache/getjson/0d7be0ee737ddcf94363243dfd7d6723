It works with languages that support the C ABI (Zig, Rust, C/C++, C#, Nim, Kotlin, etc).\nGet the locally-installed SQLite version number:\n     import { dlopen, CString, ptr, suffix, FFIType } from \"bun:ffi\";\n     const sqlite3Path = process.env.SQLITE3_PATH || `libsqlite3.${suffix}`;\n     const {\n       symbols: { sqlite3_libversion },\n     } = dlopen(sqlite3Path, {\n       sqlite3_libversion: {\n         returns: \"cstring\",\n}, });\n     console.log(\"SQLite version\", sqlite3_libversion());\nFFI is really exciting because there is no runtime-specific code. You don't have to write a Bun FFI module (that isn't a thing). Use JavaScript to write bindings to native libraries installed with homebrew, with your linux distro's package manager or elsewhere. You can also write bindings to your own native code.\nFFI has a reputation of being slower than runtime-specific APIs like napi â€“ but that's not true for bun:ffi.","backgroundColor":{"red":204,"green":214,"blue":221},"cropCandidates":[{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2784,"h":1559},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2784,"h":2784},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2784,"h":3174},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2048,"h":4096},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2784,"h":4096}],"expandedUrl":"https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1521878172005920768/photo/1","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR7Jsd1VIAAvam5.jpg","width":2784,"height":4096}]}}
