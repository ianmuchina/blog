It's like a foreign function interface API but faster\nBuffer (like in Node.js) is now a global, but the implementation is incomplete - see tracking issue. If you import \"buffer\", it continues to use the browser polyfill so this shouldn't be a breaking change\n2x faster TextEncoder & TextDecoder thanks to some fixes to the vectorization (SIMD) code\nFaster TypedArray.from. JavaScriptCore's implementation of TypedArray.from uses the code path for JS iterators when it could instead use an optimized code path for copying elements from an array, like V8 does. I have filed an upstream bug with WebKit about this, but I expect to do a more thorough fix for this in Bun and upstream that. For now, Bun reuses TypedArray.prototype.set when possible\n17x faster Uint8Array.fill\nBun.Transpiler gets an API for removing & replacing exports\nSHA512, SHA256","backgroundColor":{"red":204,"green":214,"blue":221},"cropCandidates":[{"x":0,"y":2181,"w":3420,"h":1915},{"x":0,"y":676,"w":3420,"h":3420},{"x":0,"y":197,"w":3420,"h":3899},{"x":1126,"y":0,"w":2048,"h":4096},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":3420,"h":4096}],"expandedUrl":"https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1521878166016454656/photo/1","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR7Jet5VEAEong2.jpg","width":3420,"height":4096}],"conversation_count":1,"news_action_type":"conversation"}
