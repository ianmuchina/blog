I decided to make a [new theme](https://github.com/ianmuchina/purple) from scratch. This helped me improve my frontend skills a little. The theme isn't quite yet complete, but it's good enough.

For the static site generator, I chose `Hugo` because of its speed & simplicity. The tradeoff is that feature-wise, it's limited. Although it doesn't matter that much for a blog.

I also transferred my domain from NameCheap to Cloudflare. It made sense since I was already using Cloudflare for DNS. The costs are crazy. Literally wholesale pricing. Only on transfers & renewals. You need an existing domain.
